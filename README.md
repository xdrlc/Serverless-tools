# Cloud Privilege Escalation Path Scanner

This repository contains two scanning tools designed for auditing privilege escalation risks in cloud environments:

- **`aws_escalate.py`**: A scanning tool for AWS accounts.
- **`aliyun_escalate.py`**: A scanning tool for Aliyun accounts.

These tools are in the early stages of development and serve as a proof-of-concept (PoC). 

## **Features**
- Enumerate all roles and their attached policies.  
- Enumerate all Function Compute(FC) services/Lambda applications and functions, and map their effective roles.  
- Analyze and output confirmed privilege escalation paths.  
- Simulate cross-account contamination scenarios and output detailed attack paths.  
- Output function-based attack paths and sensitive permission locations.

Below are the detailed instructions for using each tool.

## **AWS Scanning Tool (`aws_escalate.py`)**

### **Description**
This script (aws_escalate.py) is designed to enumerate all IAM roles and Lambda functions in your AWS account, analyze their permissions, and detect possible privilege escalation paths, including cross-account contamination scenarios.

### **Setup and Usage**

1. **Modify the Credentials File**
   Update the `credentials` file located in the `.aws` directory with the following format in AWS CloudShell:
```plaintext
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = AKIA*****   # AccessKeyID
   aws_secret_access_key = ******* # SecretAccessKey
```
The role or user associated with these access keys must have permission to access all resources within the account.

2. **Run the Tool**
  Execute the script using the following command:

```plaintext
python ./aws_escalate.py -p default > aws_output.txt
```
If you do not specify a profile [-p default], you will be prompted to select one from your AWS CLI configuration.

The output of the scan will be saved to `aws_output.txt`.

3. **Download and Review Results**
After the script completes, download the `aws_output.txt` file to view the scanning results.

### **Example Output**

```plaintext
Application: my-stack
  Function: my-lambda-func
    Role ARN: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role
    CONFIRMED: ['iam:PassRole', 'lambda:CreateFunction']
  ----------------------------------------
============================================================

...

Scan the attack paths in the account.

The privilege escalation paths in the account:
    confirm: 'iam:PassRole+lambda:CreateFunction' -> 'iam:CreateRole+iam:AttachRolePolicy' -> function_escalation_method2

Here are function-based attack paths in the account.

    confirm: {iam:PassRole}my-stack:my-lambda-func+{lambda:CreateFunction}my-stack:my-lambda-func -> '{iam:CreateRole}my-stack:my-lambda-func+{iam:AttachRolePolicy}my-stack:my-lambda-func' -> function_escalation_method2

...

Account-Level and Inter-Account Attack Path Analysis
============================================================

Simulate two accounts, both of which have been provisioned with all the aforementioned applications, and detect three attack paths.

Account 1:
  The account contains the following applications:
    my-stack, another-stack
  Confirmed escalated permission: 
    ['iam:PassRole', 'lambda:CreateFunction', ...]

  The privilege escalation paths in Account 1:
    confirm: 'iam:PassRole+lambda:CreateFunction' -> 'iam:CreateRole+iam:AttachRolePolicy' -> function_escalation_method2

  Here are function-based attack paths in Account 1.

    confirm: {iam:PassRole}my-stack:my-lambda-func+{lambda:CreateFunction}my-stack:my-lambda-func -> '{iam:CreateRole}my-stack:my-lambda-func+{iam:AttachRolePolicy}my-stack:my-lambda-func' -> function_escalation_method2

...

===Check cross-account attack paths (Attack Path 3)===

1. LAYER-BASED CONTAMINATION:
   Due to Attack Path 1 or 2 in Account 1, Account 1 can infect Account 2 through Lambda Layer manipulation.
   Required permission: lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration
   Functions with Sensitive Permissions:

     Permission: lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration
     - my-stack:my-lambda-func (Role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role)
```

### **Test Cases**

- Minimal Permissions (No Escalation)
 **Setup**: Create a role with read-only permissions and associate this role with a Lambda function in the account.
 **Expected Output**:  
  - The function should be marked as "it is safe!"  
  - No privilege escalation paths should be found.  

- Confirmed Escalation Path
  **Setup**: Create a role with escalation-related permissions (e.g., `sts:AssumeRole` and `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode`), and assign it to a Lambda function.  
  **Expected Output**:  
  - The function should list these permissions as CONFIRMED.  
  - The script should output a privilege escalation path involving these permissions.  

- Cross-Account Contamination
  **Setup**: Multiple stacks/functions, at least one of which in Account 2 has the `lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration` permission, and attack strategies 1 or 2 can be implemented in Account 1 (for example, the functions in Account 1 have `sts: AssumeRole` or `lambda: UpdateFunctionCode`).
  **Expected Output**:  
  - The script should output the "LAYER-BASED CONTAMINATION" section under cross-account attack paths.  

- Invalid/Expired Credentials
  **Setup**: Run the script with invalid or expired AWS credentials.  
  **Expected Output**:  
  - The script should fail gracefully and print an error message.

## **Aliyun Scanning Tool (aliyun_escalate.py)**

### **Description**
This script (aliyun_escalate.py) enumerates all RAM roles and Function Compute (FC) functions in your Alibaba Cloud account, analyzes their permissions, and detects possible privilege escalation paths, including cross-account contamination scenarios.

### **Setup and Usage**

1. **Install Required Python Libraries**
Install Required Python Libraries

```plaintext
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

Then copy the folder "fc2" to the corresponding location of the reference function library.

## **Current Development Status**
These tools are currently in the "strawman design" phase, and we are actively working toward achieving the following goals:

1. **Automatic Identification of High-Risk Third-Party Applications**
Enhance the tools to automatically identify all third-party applications within the account that pose potential risks.

2. **Construction of Attack Paths**
Construction of Attack Paths
Leverage dangerous functions of third-party applications to construct actionable attack paths.

3. **Automated PoC Generation**
Build a comprehensive tool capable of analyzing all third-party applications and automatically generating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits to simulate potential attacks.

In addition, we used these two tools to scan the sensitive applications of Lambda on Amazon Web Services and Function Compute on Alibaba Cloud respectively. The output results are in `aliyun_output.txt` and `aws_output.txt` under the `output` folder.

## **Disclaimer**
- This script is for security research and auditing purposes only. Do not use on accounts you do not own or have explicit permission to test.  
- For large accounts, the script may take several minutes to complete enumeration.
